3) Document some design choices and the organisation of your team
Create a document named Organisation.md containing the following details:

Summary of what each team member did and how the team was organised. For example, the team may discuss the domain model together but only one person implements. This will mean we might only see commits from that person, and wonder if the other members were involved. A short explanation in Organisation.md will help this. It could be a couple of sentences for each member or a simple All members participated about the same for everything (in which case the logs should reflect this).
Short description of the strategy used to minimise the chance of concurrency errors in program execution (2-3 sentences)
Short description of how the domain model is organised (2-3 sentences)



Your submission must include a file Organisation.md containing the list of members in your team, a brief summary of what role each member played, and other information as required in various assessment components listed below.


A strategy has been employed to minimise the chance of concurrency errors such as double-bookings: 5 marks (explain in 'Organization.md'; marks awarded varies based on the strategy chosen). If no Organisation.md file is provided, or it does not contain the relevant information, then a mark of zero will be given for this component.



Domain model: 5 marks (explain in 'Organization.md'; marks awarded varies based on your appropriate use of features such as eager vs lazy fetching & cascading, and the general quality of the domain model). If no Organisation.md file is provided, or it does not contain the relevant information, then a mark of zero will be given for this component.



Teamwork: 25 marks Clear evidence that every member in the team has contributed to the project. This will be assessed by examining the code, commit logs, Organization.md, comments recorded in GitHub Issues and other information associated with your team repository. If we do not find evidence of individual contributions to the team work, marks will be deducted for this component.

We expect to see non-trivial commits, with meaningful commit messages. Different team members will do different things and different times, but we will be looking for evidence that there was communication, cooperation and collaboration. The suggested evidence for this remains at the least same as previous labs.

All members of the team will get the same mark for the project, unless one or more members have clearly not contributed enough towards the project. As mentioned earlier, it will be each team member's responsibility to convince the markers about their contributions toward the project. If you are face any team issues, talk to the members involved and/or to the lab tutors during the lab sessions. Remember there is a project help lab session throughout Week 6 too. Week01Lab Risk Assessment and Mitigation processes will help you in deciding about when to escalate your team issue to the teaching team. If you decide to escalate your team issue, you must do it well before the final project deadline (at least 6 working days).
